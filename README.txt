This is for the assessment portion of the BDD. We used the Scrabble problem for this.

This assessment was done as a pair with Lee Kebler & Diane Douglas.

You will see in the commits that we first solved the problem without Objects and then used Objects to refactor our code to something much shorter.

The function works, has complete spec coverage, writen in clear english, and has easy to understand logic.

The variable were as descriptive as we could make them in both versions & I believe the indentation to be correct as well.
